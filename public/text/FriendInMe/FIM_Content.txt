A casual side-scrolling platformer played from the perspective of a child looking out a car window, daydreaming about their imaginary friend running alongside the car across the passing scenery.

As part of a 10 person team, I was a Gameplay Programmers who worked on this Unity game project. I implemented many of the backend features, including:

User Interface System — Structure, navigation, and all supporting scripts

Player Respawn System — Custom algorithm to prevent respawning inside level geometry

Scene Transition Sequence — Logic and ordering for seamless scene progression

Gamepad Controller Support — Mapped for Xbox 360 controls

I also provided advise and feedback to the design team throughout development. The game was developed with goal of showcasing it at Melbourne PAX 2022.
