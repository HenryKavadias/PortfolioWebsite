	
I am Henry Kavadias-Barnes, Software Engineer, Game Design, and Gameplay Programmer. I earned a double bachelor's degree from Swinburne University covering Computer Science and Games and Interactivity. 

I'm passionate about games and applications that engage people, and enjoy tackling complex technical and design challenges.

I have played games for most of my life, discovering in my mid-teens that I enjoy developing them as much as playing them.  Since then I have pursued a career in Software Development and Game Design. 

I’ve contributed to a wide range of projects, continually honing my skills and expanding my experience. Each project has been a valuable, insightful, and rewarding part of my journey.
